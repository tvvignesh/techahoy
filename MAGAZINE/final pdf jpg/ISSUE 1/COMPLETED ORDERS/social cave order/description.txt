Hey, 


these are the few details about the individual pages:

Home Page: Refer Image 1
-> Login with facebook facility along with normal sign up option.
->The part on the top saying click here to start searching for places has to be javascript enabled. On clicking it slides away and the frst of the 3 questions appear. Same way the ther 2 questions appear which helps a person decide his hangout destination in the city.
-> Most visited place of the week appears as Cave of the week.
-> Best ranked places of the week appears under Most liked caves. (refreshed weekly)
-> Cavemen from manipal is a simple interview section. (A form needed in the back end to simply add these pages)

Cave Profile Pages:
Every kind of cave will have a profile page (4 categories: Connect with Nature, Bon Appetit, Nightlife and Just for Fun). We need a detailed form on the back-end after filling which a page is formed. It will contain the entire list of tags as checkboxes so that the ones we choose(like family/monetary details/food/drinks,etc). In this way pages will show up on search resutls.

Search Results:
The search results pages will show the places based on user search divided into all 4 categories.
It should have a modify search and advanced search option. (eg. under Bon Appetit -> bakery, fastfood, restaurants,etc)

User Profile Page:
Will not be too complicated. Just basic stuff like info about the person(taken from facebook). Places he'she has visited. His personal reviews, photos of places, etc.

These are the 4 main pages of the site. Rest shouldn't take much time.
